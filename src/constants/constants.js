The community will decide which NFTs to purchase, and we’ll hold those NFTs for appreciation in value. We could also purchase large stakes in other utility NFT collections. All such NFTs would then go on display in our Gallery. If our community ever decides to sell, the profit from appreciation goes to the profit pool.",

Ahead of those meetings, we'll have NFT holders drop ideas in a holders-only channel, which we'll then use to create polls for holders to vote on ideas. Then at those monthly round table meetings, we'll discuss the results of the polls and talk candidly about how to proceed. Each NFT is equal to one vote, so if you have 10 NFTs, you have 10 votes.",
